{"name":"Dublin-pubs-app","tagline":"A view of all the pubs that me and Kev have drank in, in Dublin","body":"### Idea Behind Dublin Pubs\r\nAccording to the revenue there are some 800 licensed public houses in County Dublin. My Brother and I have decided that we shall drink in them all. These apps are just a small side project to try and keep track of the drinking.\r\n\r\n### Possible Re-Use\r\nNo point in creating a public page for the apps as they are fairly specific (and basic) but feel free to copy anything that you may find useful. I'm trying to keep all the components separate, which hopefully means that each lib is fairly self explanatory. Also, the hosting of the app at the moment is on openshift. They offer free gears for test apps so the backend is running on WildFly and the datastore is PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\n### Libraries/Technologies Used\r\n[Onsen UI](http://s.onsen.io/)\r\n\r\n[Lombok](http://projectlombok.org/)\r\n\r\n[JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/)\r\n\r\n[JPA - Hibernate](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to contact me at https://github.com/irishshagua or brian_satchwannabe@hotmail.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
